          <h2>My heart engraved metaphor</h2>
          <p>2 Corinthians 3:3 tells us that our hearts can be engraved with a leter from Christ, known and read by everyone, just as the sacred tablets were engraved in the Old Testament by the finger of God. The passage goes on to describe in verse 18 how we are transformed as we "contemplate the Lord's glory". I believe that one way to do this is to meditate on scriptures that we have memorized and allow the Spirit to direct our thoughts.</p>
          <p>This metaphor of engraving reminds me of the Japanese tradition of Kintsugi, where broken pottery is repaired with gold. The broken pieces are not discarded, nor is there an attempt to conceal the damage, but rather the cracks are highlighted with gold to create a new and beautiful piece of art. I believe that through memorization and meditation the Holy Spirit can use us in our weakness and inlay the cracks with gold.</p>

          <h2>My Story</h2>
          <p>I memorized a lot of scripture as a child and teenage through AWANA, Bible Quizzing, and the National Bible Bee. However, at that time, it never fully clicked for me why Scripture memorization was important, other than for the fun of the competition and the praise I received for memorizing verses. </p>
          <p>One day in my mid-twenties, my church hosted a scripture reading event where we read through significant portions of scripture out loud. Although I did not come in entirely enthusiastic, something about the relaxing atmosphere and the familiarity of the passages I had previously memorized caused me to step outside of my analytical brain and focus on the message and emotions the passage was truly portraying. </p>          
          <p>Since that day I have re-incorporated scripture memory into my daily routine, and find if I know scripture well enough that I can run through them in my head without exerting significant mental effort, then I am able to more easily step outside of my analytical brain and into the presence of the Lord when I hear these scriptures either read out loud in a church setting, or during my own personal devotional time. </p>    
          <p>I have created this app to help both myself and others to engage in scripture memory in an easy and fun way. </p>
